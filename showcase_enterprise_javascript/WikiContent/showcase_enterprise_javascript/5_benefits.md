> Benefits
====================

> ###Completeness
  
  * Rich, but still standardized APIs
  * Expose legacy components and frameworks to the new environment;

> ###Portability

  * No tight vendor lock-in to the currently chosen underlying JavaScript platform
  * OS, platform and database agnostic
  * Developers can stick to native JavaScript objects and primitives only in their source code

> ###Lifecycle
  
  * The API itself is a standard Eclipse Dirigible project, hence can have the same lifecycle as the rest of the projects
